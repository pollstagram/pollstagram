		<h4 class="media-heading">Entertaining</h4>
		People are curious about what other people think. Currently, many sites are devoted to this notion, such as <a href="http://www.rrrather.com">rrrather</a> and <a href="http://www.weirdpoll.com">weirdpoll</a> where each question typically garners hundred of thousands of answers. However, these sites focus on merely providing entertainment value. Our service allows you to explore <a href="{% url 'tags_questions' 'fun' %}">scintillating tidbits</a> from our diverse user base, and much more.

		<h4 class="media-heading">Informative</h4>
		With the advent of awesome question and answer services such as <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a> and <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a> which are focused on being insightful and educational, we wanted to our service to strike a good balance between being fun and educational by modelling elements of our service against some of Stackoverflow's user interface and functionality. Here you can do things like upvote questions that are insightful and informative, tag questions under a particular category and thereby view questions with high scores relevant to your interests.

		<h4 class="media-heading">Less is More</h4>
		Though user's cannot provide lengthy answers, but rather select a specific choice to help indicate community sentiments, we believe this will be useful in the same way that services like <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> and Snapchat are, where a constrained form of user input actually induces and encourages further user interaction.
